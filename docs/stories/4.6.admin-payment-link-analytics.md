# Story 4.6: Admin Payment Link Analytics

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As an** admin,
**I want** to track payment link performance with conversion metrics and usage analytics,
**so that** I understand which prospects are converting and optimize outreach strategies.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Payment links page at `/admin/payment-links` displays enhanced table with analytics
2. Table columns: Token (truncated, copyable), Prospect Email, Product, Created Date, Expires Date, Status (ACTIVE, USED, EXPIRED), Used Date, Converted (Yes/No)
3. Status badges color-coded: ACTIVE (green), USED (blue), EXPIRED (gray)
4. Converted column shows checkmark if payment completed, X if user registered but didn't pay
5. Filters: Status (multi-select), Product (multi-select), Date Range (created date)
6. Search bar filters by prospect email
7. Sort by: Created Date, Expiration Date, Used Date
8. Analytics summary cards above table:
   - Total Links Created (with date range filter)
   - Active Links (not yet used, not expired)
   - Conversion Rate (USED links with successful payment / Total USED links)
   - Average Time to Conversion (time from link creation to payment completion)
9. Clicking link row expands details: Full token URL (copyable), User who used it (if used), Order status, Payment amount, Timeline of events
10. "Generate Link" button prominently placed, opens creation form (from Epic 1)
11. Bulk actions: Expire selected links (mark as EXPIRED, disable further use)
12. Export functionality: CSV export of all links with full details for external analysis
13. Conversion funnel visualization (optional): Link Created → Link Clicked → Registration → Payment
14. Email reminders for admins: Daily digest of unused links expiring soon

## Dev Notes

### Database Schema Context

**payment_links table:**
```
- id: uuid (PK)
- token: text (unique, 32-char secure token)
- prospect_email: text
- product_id: uuid (FK)
- created_at: timestamp
- expires_at: timestamp
- used_at: timestamp (nullable)
- status: enum (ACTIVE, USED, EXPIRED)
- created_by: uuid (admin user)
```

**orders/payments linked to payment_links:**
- `order.payment_link_id` → payment_links.id
- Track payment completion to measure conversion

### Payment Link Status Logic

- **ACTIVE**: Created, not yet used, not expired
- **USED**: Token clicked and user registered
- **EXPIRED**: expires_at timestamp passed or manually expired

### Conversion Rate Calculation

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE payments.status = 'PAID') as converted_count,
  COUNT(*) as total_used_links,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE payments.status = 'PAID')::numeric
    / COUNT(*) * 100,
    2
  ) as conversion_rate
FROM payment_links pl
LEFT JOIN orders o ON pl.id = o.payment_link_id
LEFT JOIN payments p ON o.id = p.order_id
WHERE pl.status = 'USED'
  AND pl.created_at >= $1  -- date range start
  AND pl.created_at <= $2  -- date range end
```

### Average Time to Conversion

```sql
SELECT
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.created_at - pl.created_at))/3600) as avg_hours,
  AVG(EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (p.created_at - pl.created_at))/86400) as avg_days
FROM payment_links pl
JOIN orders o ON pl.id = o.payment_link_id
JOIN payments p ON o.id = p.order_id
WHERE p.status = 'PAID'
  AND pl.created_at >= $1
  AND pl.created_at <= $2
```

### Funnel Data Query

```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT pl.id) as created_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN pl.used_at IS NOT NULL THEN pl.id END) as clicked_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM orders o WHERE o.payment_link_id = pl.id
  ) THEN pl.id END) as registered_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM payments p
    JOIN orders o ON p.order_id = o.id
    WHERE o.payment_link_id = pl.id
    AND p.status = 'PAID'
  ) THEN pl.id END) as paid_count
FROM payment_links pl
WHERE pl.created_at >= $1 AND pl.created_at <= $2
```

### Analytics Cards Layout

```
┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐
│ Total Links  │ Active Links │ Conversion   │ Avg Time to  │
│   1,234      │     234      │  45.6%       │ 3.2 days     │
└──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┴──────────────┘
```

### Token Display and Copy

- Truncate token in table: "abc123def456...xyz789"
- Show full token in expanded details
- Add copy button next to full token
- Copy to clipboard on button click

### CSV Export Format

```
Token,Email,Product,Created Date,Expires Date,Status,Used Date,Converted,Order ID,Payment Amount
abc123def456...xyz789,john@example.com,LLC Formation,2026-01-01,2026-02-01,USED,2026-01-05,Yes,ORD-123,999.99
...
```

### Expiration Reminder Email Template

Subject: "Payment Links Expiring Soon (Daily Digest)"

Body:
```
Dear Admin,

The following payment links expire in the next 24 hours:

[Table with: Email, Product, Expires At, Status]
- john@example.com | LLC Formation | 2026-01-07 14:30 | ACTIVE
- jane@example.com | Dubai Company | 2026-01-08 09:15 | ACTIVE

Total expiring: 5 links
Active (not yet used): 3 links
Expired: 2 links

Action Items:
- Follow up with prospects on unused links
- Consider extending expiration if needed

Best regards,
Partners VRAI Platform
```

### Funnel Visualization (Recharts)

```tsx
<BarChart data={funnelData}>
  <CartesianGrid strokeDasharray="3 3" />
  <XAxis dataKey="stage" />
  <YAxis />
  <Tooltip />
  <Legend />
  <Bar dataKey="count" fill="#00F0FF" />
  <Bar dataKey="percentage" fill="#4ADE80" />
</BarChart>
```

### Daily Cron Job Implementation

Use `pg_cron` extension in PostgreSQL:
```sql
SELECT cron.schedule('email-expiring-links', '0 9 * * *', 'SELECT send_expiring_links_email()');
```

Or use external job queue (Bull, pg-boss).
